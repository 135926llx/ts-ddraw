ts-ddraw
========

Rewrite of cnc-ddraw for Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2. Target audience are Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10 and Wine users who have performance or rendering issues.

Notes on Origin
---------------

If you installed Red Alert 2 / Yuri's Revenge from Origin, you need to disable Windows 95 compatibility mode for your game executables, as Origin by default enables this "feature".

TODO
----
  * Direct3D backend as an alternative to OpenGL
  * Support scaling
